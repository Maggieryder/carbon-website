## Get the kit

1. [**Install Sketch**](https://www.sketchapp.com/). To design with Carbon you must have the most recent version of Sketch installed.
2. [**Add libraries**](#design-great-digital-experiences-with-carbon). The Carbon and the IBM Design Language Sketch libraries are regularly updated to reflect the current state of Carbon. Visit the linked pages and click "Add library".
3. [**Get the grid template**](sketch://add-library/cloud/ngV7z). This template comes prepopulated with the IBM Design Language grid.
4. **Optional:** [**Install the kit locally**](https://client.sketch.cloud/v1/documents/5975944e-665c-4863-90c3-898dc574cf78/download/Carbon+Design+System+V10-beta.sketch?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZGVudCI6IjU5NzU5NDRlLTY2NWMtNDg2My05MGMzLTg5OGRjNTc0Y2Y3OCIsImF1ZCI6Ikpva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNTUyMzM3NjQ4LCJpYXQiOjE1NTIzMzQwNDgsImlzcyI6Ikpva2VuIiwianRpIjoiMm01ZnY1dDdzdGs0OXVxdWEwMDJwcHRoIiwibmJmIjoxNTUyMzM0MDQ4fQ.wxhFTYjqqoCEupHMK1yfqnJIyvxsH20jOyMAPcabqx0). The cloud libraries contain everything you need to start designing with Carbon, but our full Sketch kit offers additional guidance that will be useful if you're new to Carbon. This kit will not be automatically updated.

You're all set! Once in Sketch, select "New document" and begin designing.

## Anatomy of the kit

See the [Sketch Cloud library](https://sketch.cloud/s/JaVzz/) page for an overview of the kit before downloading.

### Symbols

*Symbols* are just Sketch versions of Carbon components, add-ons, and icons.

***screenshot needed***

There are two kinds of symbols — `library symbols` and `document symbols`. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.

From the main menu select **Insert → Symbols → Document/Library (depending)** to add symbols onto your page. 

***screenshot needed***

If you've never designed with symbol-based components before, they can get a bit confusing.

#### Structure

Symbols are organized by component; after selecting a component, you'll see the variations, pieces and states of that component. 

- To add the whole component, simply locate the variant you want and drag it into the work space.

- For even more configurablility, use the individual building blocks under "Pieces." Be sure your custom design adheres to our [design guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview).

### Text styles

Text styles are based on the typography rules that are defined in Carbon Elements.

![Text styles navigation example](images/text-styles-1.png)

</ImageComponent>

From the main menu select **Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Design System** to insert a Carbon type token text style. 

You can adjust text styles within components by selecting any text box and clicking **Appearance → Text Style** in the control panel.

#### Structure
- The first text style level displays [theme options](/guidelines/themes) (i.e., white theme). 
- The second level shows the [Carbon type](/guidelines/typography) tokens (i.e., body-long-01). 
- The third level selects the type color which are labeled with their [Carbon color](/guidelines/color) token name.

### Layer styles

Select a shape then go to Appearance → Layer Style dropdown → Color tokens in the right control panel to apply the Carbon color tokens to an element. Layer Styles can only be applied to shape layers, they can not be applied to text.

The first layer is the theme selection (ie 01 White theme). The second layer is core Carbon color tokens (ie field-01) for the selected them. The interaction state tokens are nested in a third layer under “state”.

## Info

### Updates

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. These changes are made to the Sketch Cloud kit and you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window. 

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.
