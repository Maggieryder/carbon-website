### Design great digital experiences with Carbon

The Carbon Design toolkit consists of three parts: The IBM Design Language kit, the Carbon kit, and the IBM Design Language grid template. Clicking the tiles below installs each.

## Get the kit

1. [**Install Sketch**](https://www.sketchapp.com/). To design with Carbon you must have the most recent version of Sketch installed.
2. [**Add libraries**](#design-great-digital-experiences-with-carbon). Designing with Carbon requires subscribing to two libraries: The IBM Design Language kit and the Carbon kit Click the tiles above to subscribe to each. Both libraries are required.
    - The [IBM Design Language](sketch://add-library/cloud/75VZZ) offers fonts, colors, icons, and other resources shared across all embodiments of the IBM Design Language.
    - The [Carbon](sketch://add-library/cloud/JaVzz) library contains all Carbon component symbols, color swatches, text styles, and layer styles.
3. [**Download the grid template**](https://client.sketch.cloud/v1/documents/b10cdce8-6f00-40be-982e-8f3bec7b99a4/download/IBM+Grid+template.sketch?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZGVudCI6ImIxMGNkY2U4LTZmMDAtNDBiZS05ODJlLThmM2JlYzdiOTlhNCIsImF1ZCI6Ikpva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNTUyNTk4MzEwLCJpYXQiOjE1NTI1OTQ3MTAsImlzcyI6Ikpva2VuIiwianRpIjoiMm01dXBhZXFrdjQzZWY1dTdnMDVjYjNoIiwibmJmIjoxNTUyNTk0NzEwfQ.W65i38VrMMZeKg0KvcOVsaJByBexOu1IYmKUZGJ1nug). Click on the Grid tile at the top of this page and, once downloaded, open the file in Sketch. Navigate to `File → Save as Template...`. You can now access the saved grid template at `File → New file from Template`.

## Getting started

To get started with Carbon, familiarize yourself with the contents of each library.

1. **Start with the grid**. At the top of your screen, navigate to `File → New file from Template` and select your grid template. You'll always be able to find the template here.
2. **Icons and color swatches**. Symbols from both the IBM Design Language library and the Carbon library are accessible from any Sketch document. Navigage to `Insert → Symbols → Carbon Design System` or  `IBM Design Language`.
3. **You're all set**. Refer to the content below for a more detailed breakdown of the kit, or head to Sketch to begin designing.

## Anatomy

See the [Sketch library](https://sketch.cloud/s/JaVzz/) page for an overview of the kit before downloading.

### Grid

The *IBM 2x Grid* is the framework for laying out all visual elements in Carbon.

<ImageComponent cols="8" caption="2x Grid overview">

![2x Grid overview](/images/grid-1.png)

</ImageComponent>

All designs should start with the 2x Grid template. Once you have successfully [saved the grid](#gat-the-kit) as a template, navigate to `File → New file from Template` and select the grid template.

#### Structure

At the core of the 2x Grid concept is the idea of divisions of two. This can be applied to most surfaces, 3-D objects, and architecture as a means to divide space into a helpful grid system. 

Dividing your space into 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 columns gives you the basis of the system with the purpose of helping you make decisions and organize your content.

You can see a full breakdown of the 2x Grid at [IBM.com/design](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/elements/2x-grid).

### Symbols

*Symbols* are Sketch versions of Carbon [components](/components/overview), [add-ons](/contributing/add-ons), and [icons](/guidelines/iconography/library).

<ImageComponent cols="8" caption="IDL symbol menu navigation">

![Carbon symbol menu navigation](/images/IDL-kit-library.png)

</ImageComponent>



There are two kinds of symbols — `library symbols` and `document symbols`. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.

From the `Insert` menu, select `Symbols → Carbon Design System` to add symbols onto your page.

Carbon symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.

#### Structure

Symbols are organized by component; after selecting a component, you'll see the variations, pieces and states of that component. 

- To add the whole component, simply locate the variant you want and drag it into the work space.

- For even more configurablility, use the individual building blocks under "Pieces." Be sure your custom design adheres to our [design guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview).

### Text styles

*Text styles* are based on the typography rules that are defined by the [IBM Design Language](/guidelines/typography/overview).

<ImageComponent cols="8" caption="Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Design System">

![Text styles navigation example](images/text-styles-1.png)

</ImageComponent>

From the main menu select `Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Design System` to insert a Carbon type token text style. 

You can adjust text styles within components by selecting any text box and clicking `Appearance → Text Style` in the control panel.

#### Structure

Carbon text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.

- The first text style level displays [theme options](/guidelines/themes) (i.e., white theme). 
- The second level shows the [Carbon type](/guidelines/typography) tokens (i.e., body-long-01). 
- The third level selects the type color which are labeled with their [Carbon color](/guidelines/color) token name.

### Layer styles

*Layer styles* are color selections for any shape in Sketch.

<ImageComponent cols="8" caption="Use predetermined overrides when possible">

![Layer styles navigation example](/images/layer-style-1.png)

</ImageComponent>

[Color](/guidelines/color/overview) in Carbon is carefully considered, and we discourage custom layer styles.

The first layer is the theme selection (i.e., 01 White theme). The second layer is core Carbon color tokens (i.e., field-01) for the selected them. The interaction state tokens are nested in a third layer under “state”.

### Tutorials

Brand new to Sketch? Here are a few tutorials we really like . Check them out and come see us when you're done!

- A great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suP1sOU4J3E) on Sketch Library basics.
- An [article](https://medium.com/ux-power-tools/sketch-libraries-how-they-work-and-the-crazy-stuff-you-can-do-with-them-fc10f142ac80) on Sketch libraries (if videos aren't your thing).


### Updates

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window. 

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.

### Migration

If you're currently using an older version of Carbon, check out our [migration docs](updates/v10-migration/designers) when you're ready to make the switch to Carbon X.
