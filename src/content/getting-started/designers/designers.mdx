### Updates

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. These changes are made to the Sketch Cloud kit and you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window. 

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.
