## Get the kit

1. [**Install Sketch**](https://www.sketchapp.com/). To design with Carbon you must have the most recent version of Sketch installed.
2. [**Add libraries**](#design-great-digital-experiences-with-carbon). The Carbon and the IBM Design Language Sketch libraries are regularly updated to reflect the current state of Carbon. Visit the linked pages and click "Add library".
3. [**Get the grid template**](sketch://add-library/cloud/ngV7z). This template comes prepopulated with the IBM Design Language grid.
4. **Optional:** [**Install the kit locally**](https://client.sketch.cloud/v1/documents/5975944e-665c-4863-90c3-898dc574cf78/download/Carbon+Design+System+V10-beta.sketch?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZGVudCI6IjU5NzU5NDRlLTY2NWMtNDg2My05MGMzLTg5OGRjNTc0Y2Y3OCIsImF1ZCI6Ikpva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNTUyMzM3NjQ4LCJpYXQiOjE1NTIzMzQwNDgsImlzcyI6Ikpva2VuIiwianRpIjoiMm01ZnY1dDdzdGs0OXVxdWEwMDJwcHRoIiwibmJmIjoxNTUyMzM0MDQ4fQ.wxhFTYjqqoCEupHMK1yfqnJIyvxsH20jOyMAPcabqx0). The cloud libraries contain everything you need to start designing with Carbon, but our full Sketch kit offers additional guidance that will be useful if you're new to Carbon. This kit will not be automatically updated.

You're all set! Once in Sketch, select "New document" and begin designing.

## Anatomy of the kit

See the [Sketch Cloud library](https://sketch.cloud/s/JaVzz/) page for an overview of the kit before downloading.

#### The kit is composed of Carbon components (symbols), text styles, icons, embedded color tokens as layer styles, and grid templates.

### Symbols

There are two kinds of symbols — `library symbols` and `document symbols`. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.

From the main menu select **Insert → Symbols → Document/Library (depending)** to add symbols onto your page.

Symbols are organized by components; within each component layer are the variations, pieces and states of each component. Component symbols are organized in layers within the library. 

- Under each component layer are the variations, pieces and states of each component. From the “group” layer in component symbol you can add the each whole component. 

- For even more configurablility, use “item” component symbols to build your configuration. Use these symbols and templates as a base for your designs.

### Text Styles

![Text styles navigation example](images/text-styles-1.png)

</ImageComponent>

From the main menu select **Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Design System** to insert a Carbon type token text style. Text styles are based on the typography rules that are defined in Carbon Elements. You can also access Text Styles by selecting any text box then in the right control panel click **Appearance → Text Style**.

The first Text Style level is to pick the theme (ie White theme). The second level is the actual Carbon type tokens (ie body-long-01). The third level is the type color choices which are labeled with their Carbon color token name. 

**Type style / theme / type token / color**

### Layer styles

Select a shape then go to Appearance → Layer Style dropdown → Color tokens in the right control panel to apply the Carbon color tokens to an element. Layer Styles can only be applied to shape layers, they can not be applied to text.

The first layer is the theme selection (ie 01 White theme). The second layer is core Carbon color tokens (ie field-01) for the selected them. The interaction state tokens are nested in a third layer under “state”.

### Library symbols — usage

Use Insert → Symbols → Carbon Design System to add symbols from the Carbon Design Kit symbol library to your document. They are organized in groups including components, icons and add-ons. Use these symbols and templates as a base for your design or as a drag-and-drop design system.

Use “group” component symbols add full component templates or use the “item” component symbols to build your configuration. Use these symbols and templates as a base for your designs.

## Info

### Updates

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. These changes are made to the Sketch Cloud kit and you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window. 

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.
